Subject: [Hjb-developers] [ANN] HJB-0.8.2 (HTTP JMS Bridge) released
Message-ID: <336ade8a0606210616q30f6b3bdnbc87ef5aa1aefc9f@mail.gmail.com>

HJB provides access to JMS resources via HTTP.

HJB <http://hjb.berlios.de>

* is **language-neutral**: it will allow the writing of software
  libraries for communicating with JMS providers in any language
  that has libraries for communicating over HTTP.

* is **RESTful**: it provides a RESTful equivalent to all of the
  non-optional portions of the JMS API including

  - registration of resources administered by the messaging provider

  - connection and session management

  - sending and receipt of all types of JMS message

HJB is free software, released under the LGPL license.  HJB-0.8.2 is
the latest release.

A companion project, PyHJB <http://hjb.python-hosting.com> has
released a python client for HJB, so it is now possible to write JMS
messaging programs in 100% pure python.

For further information, see the HJB website <http://hjb.berlios.de>.

Please send any comments and suggestions to the HJB users mailing list
<mailto:hjb-users at lists.berlios.de>. Bugs should be reported on the
HJB trac <http://hjb.python-hosting.com/newticket?component=hjb>
